# Privacy Policy

Vocabulary Recall respects your privacy.

## Data Collection
Vocabulary Recall does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

All vocabulary words, learning progress, and settings are stored locally on the user's device using Chrome local storage.

## Use of Data
The data stored locally is used solely to provide vocabulary recall reminders and progress summaries.

## Third-Party Services
Vocabulary Recall does not use analytics, tracking, or advertising services.

If users explicitly request AI-generated content, only the selected vocabulary word is sent to the AI service to generate example data. No browsing content or personal data is transmitted.

## Data Sharing
No data is shared with third parties.

## Changes
This privacy policy may be updated if new features are introduced that affect data handling.

## Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, you may contact the developer via the Chrome Web Store listing.
